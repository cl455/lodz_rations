## Dear Christine

If you're reading this, it means that you remembered the answer to 'How do I git pull?' and that your presentation is probably coming up. I always pictured myself here on this day, to make sure you set an alarm for the wee hours, to ask you how it went afterwards, and to wish I could be there to celebrate with you, even while you insisted that you'll still have months of fellowship research left to conduct.

I left some notes in the README about how you could host this visualizer online so everyone at the museum can play with it on their own computers, and added some of the things that we had talked about doing.

I know that you sometimes hesitated to ask me for an extra pair of eyes on this, whether it was because you thought maybe I'd rather be watching Grey's instead, or because you yourself didn't really want to work on it at that moment either. And while I do rag on being able to do this work, I enjoyed every minute of being able to work on it with you. You've had a pesky track record of tricking me into caring about things that I never thought I would care about (digital humanitus, LA, data visualiations, you), and it's because you care so deeply so much of the time. You might sometimes think that you whine, that you look for every excuse to instead watch one of Britney's vlogs, but watching you shut yourself in a room to edit your thesis or transcribe ration announcements made me wish I was doing the same. And I think that you know that you're a badass. I've told you about a person in my life who's inspired me to be a better version of myself, but I think you might be that person now. You inspire me.

No poem on a sticky note this time, because I know they'll hear you tell the story of this work and be mesmerized once again. Let me know what type of praise they heap onto you.

I hope you are well and that you're finding the joys that you deserve. Rooting for you, always.

Andrew
